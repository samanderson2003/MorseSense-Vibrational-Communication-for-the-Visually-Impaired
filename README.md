# MorseSense: Vibrational Communication for the Visually Impaired

## Description

**MorseSense** is an accessibility-focused mobile application that allows visually impaired individuals to read and write messages using Morse code through vibration feedback. The app translates Morse input into English text and vice versa, enabling seamless communication between blind and sighted users.

## Features

- Convert English text to Morse code and feel it through vibrations
- Write text using Morse code taps (dot/dash) and see it converted to English
- Two-way communication between blind and sighted individuals
- Simple and intuitive user interface

## How It Works

- **Input**: Users tap short (dot) and long (dash) patterns to write messages.
- **Output**: The app vibrates to convey incoming Morse code, and displays the equivalent English text on-screen.
- Designed for both blind and sighted users.

## Tech Stack

- React Native 
- Haptic feedback 
- Morse code encoder/decoder logic
